# BVCN-Jupyter_rise
BVCN Jupyter base with RISE slideshow support added for use via MyBInder.org.

See [here](https://github.com/fomightez/BVCN-Jupyter_base) for base version for use by learners.

The version that launches from here has RISE slideshow ability as well. This was made a new repository in order to decrease clutter of toolbar for learners. **THIS VERSION IS MEANT TO BE USED BY INSTRUCTORS SO THEY CAN USE THE RISE SLIDESHOWS TO CLEARLY SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE CODE CELLS.**
