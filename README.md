# BVCN-Jupyter_rise
BVCN Jupyter base with RISE slideshow support added for use via MyBInder.org.

See [here](https://github.com/fomightez/BVCN-Jupyter_base) for base version for use by learners.

The version that launches from here has RISE slideshow ability as well. This was made a new repository in order to decrease clutter of toolbar for learners. **THIS VERSION IS MEANT TO BE USED BY INSTRUCTORS SO THEY CAN USE THE RISE SLIDESHOWS TO CLEARLY SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE CODE CELLS.**

Technical note:

RISE only works in the classic notebook mode. Therefore, upon launch the session starts in that interface. You can switch to JupyterLab by editing the URL. HOW TO DO THAT TBD and placed here!!!
